# 🌸 My Arduino Journey

**Open Source Hardware & Software | GPL-3.0 Licensed**

Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I play with Arduinos and make cool electronics projects! Everything here is open source - which means you can build, learn, modify, and share anything you like! 💖

## ✨ Why Check Out My Projects?

- Super clean and well-explained code (I try my best! 🥹)
- Step-by-step guides for when I have time to make them
- Beginner-friendly explanations because we all start somewhere!

## 🌈 My Open Source Vibes

**GPL-3.0 License** - Basically means:
- ✅ **Go ahead!** Build these for fun or school projects
- ✅ **Learn from them** - I learned from others too!
- ✅ **Make them better** - Modify and improve everything
- ✅ **Share your creations** - Show the world what you made!
- 🔒 **Just remember** - Keep your versions open source too
- 🚫 **Please don't** Sell them as closed products

*I believe sharing knowledge helps everyone grow! 🌟*

## 🎀 My Current Skill Set
- Arduino Programming (C++)

## 👋 About Me

Just a 16-year-old girl who fell in love with electronics and coding! I'm learning as I go and having the best time making things that blink, beep, and sometimes actually work! 🤣

*"Life is like a breadboard - sometimes you have to try a few connections before you get it right!"*
